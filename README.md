# Matlab-DataAnalysis
Analyze prefrontal-caudate data

Data is opened and analyzed by an API called Monkeywrench. This takes care of opening individual experiments and visualize neural data, or a batch of multiple experiments at a time. Typically, I write one short matlab script that extracts one type of neural/behavioral data, and use monkeywrench as a wrapper to run this script on selected experimental sessions.
